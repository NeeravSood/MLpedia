Algorithm Name: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Type: Unsupervised Learning
Category: Generative Models

Overview
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised learning, invented by Ian Goodfellow in 2014. They are designed for generating new data instances that resemble your training data.

Key Concepts

- Generator: Generates new data instances.
- Discriminator: Evaluates data for authenticity; distinguishes between real and generated data.
- Adversarial Training: Framework where generator and discriminator improve their methods in competition with each other.

How It Works
GANs operate through a dueling network setup. The generator creates data, and the discriminator assesses it. Initially, both networks undergo training with real data so that they learn how to produce and evaluate genuine-looking data.

Mathematical Model (Optional)
`min_G max_D V(D, G) = E_x[log D(x)] + E_z[log(1 - D(G(z)))]`

Pseudocode
```
initialize generator G and discriminator D
for number of training iterations do
    for k steps do
        Sample minibatch of m noise samples {z1, ..., zm} from noise prior p_g(z)
        Sample minibatch of m examples {x1, ..., xm} from data generating distribution p_data(x)
        Update the discriminator by ascending its stochastic gradient:
            ∇_θd[1/m ∑ log D(x) + log(1 - D(G(z)))]
    Sample minibatch of m noise samples {z1, ..., zm}
    Update the generator by descending its stochastic gradient:
        ∇_θg[1/m ∑ log(1 - D(G(z)))]
```

Implementation (Python Example)
```python
def train_gan(generator, discriminator, data_loader, epochs):
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        for real_data in data_loader:
             Train discriminator and generator as described in pseudocode
            pass
```

Applications
- Image generation and enhancement
- Creating realistic animations
- Data augmentation for training machine learning models

Strengths
- Ability to generate high-quality, realistic images and data.
- Useful in unsupervised learning tasks where labeled data is scarce.

Limitations
- Training can be unstable and models may fail to converge.
- Generated samples may exhibit odd artifacts.
