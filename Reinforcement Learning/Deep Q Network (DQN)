Algorithm Name: Deep Q Network (DQN)

Type: Reinforcement Learning

Overview  
Deep Q Network (DQN) is a reinforcement learning algorithm that combines neural networks with a Q-learning framework to create efficient learning models from high-dimensional sensory inputs. Developed initially by DeepMind, it became prominent through its ability to master several Atari 2600 games.

Key Concepts
- Q-Learning: A model-free reinforcement learning algorithm.
- Experience Replay: Storing and reusing past experiences to break correlation between sequential experiences.
- Deep Neural Networks: Approximating the optimal action-value function.

How It Works  
DQN uses a neural network to approximate the Q-value of state-action pairs. The network updates based on the reward received and the new state reached, using experiences sampled from a replay buffer to minimize correlations.

Mathematical Model
(Optional section where the Bellman equation modification applied in DQN can be discussed.)

Pseudocode
```
Initialize replay memory D to capacity N
Initialize action-value function Q with random weights
for episode = 1, M do
    Initialize sequence s1 = {x1} and preprocessed sequenced φ1 = φ(s1)
    for t = 1, T do
        With probability ε select a random action at
        otherwise select at = argmax_a Q(φ(st), a; θ)
        Execute action at in emulator and observe reward rt and image xt+1
        Set st+1 = st, at, xt+1 and preprocess φt+1 = φ(st+1)
        Store transition (φt, at, rt, φt+1) in D
        Sample random minibatch of transitions (φj, aj, rj, φj+1) from D
        Set yj = rj if episode terminates at step j+1
            otherwise set yj = rj + γ max_a' Q(φj+1, a'; θ)
        Perform a gradient descent step on (yj - Q(φj, aj; θ))^2 with respect to the network parameters θ
    end for
end for
```

Implementation (Python)
```python
def dqn_algorithm(params):
    # implementation details
    return result
```

Applications
- Video game AI
- Robotics navigation
- Complex decision-making tasks

Strengths
- Handles high-dimensional sensory inputs.
- Learns optimal policies directly from raw pixels.

Limitations
- Computationally expensive and high memory consumption.
- Can overfit in smaller or simpler problems.
