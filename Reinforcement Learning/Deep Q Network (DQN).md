# Algorithm Name: Deep Q Network (DQN)

**Type:** Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
Deep Q Network (DQN) is a reinforcement learning algorithm that combines neural networks with a Q-learning framework to create efficient learning models from high-dimensional sensory inputs. Initially developed by DeepMind, it gained prominence through its ability to master several Atari 2600 games.

## Key Concepts
- **Q-Learning:** A model-free reinforcement learning algorithm.
- **Experience Replay:** Storing and reusing past experiences to break correlation between sequential experiences.
- **Deep Neural Networks:** Used for approximating the optimal action-value function.

## How It Works
DQN uses a neural network to approximate the Q-value of state-action pairs. The network updates based on the reward received and the new state reached, using experiences sampled from a replay buffer to minimize correlations.

## Mathematical Model

In DQN, the Bellman equation is modified to accommodate the use of neural networks for function approximation. This modification allows the network to iteratively improve its predictions of Q-values. Here's the foundational equation:

### Bellman Equation for Q-Learning:
\[ Q^*(s, a) = \mathbb{E} \left[ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q^*(s', a') \mid s, a \right] \]

In DQN, the target Q-value for the update is calculated using the formula:
\[ Q_{\text{target}} = r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a'; \theta^-) \]
where:
- \( r \) is the reward received after taking action \( a \) in state \( s \),
- \( \gamma \) is the discount factor,
- \( s' \) is the new state after action \( a \),
- \( a' \) is the possible next action,
- \( \theta^- \) represents the parameters of a target network that are periodically updated with the weights of the main network to stabilize learning.

The loss function used for learning is:
\[ L(\theta) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \left( Q_{\text{target}} - Q(s, a; \theta) \right)^2 \right] \]

This loss function minimizes the difference between the predicted Q-value and the Q-value calculated by the Bellman equation, thus enabling the network to approximate the true Q-function more accurately.

## Pseudocode
```plaintext
Initialize replay memory D to capacity N
Initialize action-value function Q with random weights
for episode = 1, M do
    Initialize sequence s1 = {x1} and preprocessed sequenced φ1 = φ(s1)
    for t = 1, T do
        With probability ε select a random action at
        otherwise select at = argmax_a Q(φ(st), a; θ)
        Execute action at in emulator and observe reward rt and image xt+1
        Set st+1 = st, at, xt+1 and preprocess φt+1 = φ(st+1)
        Store transition (φt, at, rt, φt+1) in D
        Sample random minibatch of transitions (φj, aj, rj, φj+1) from D
        Set yj = rj if episode terminates at step j+1
            otherwise set yj = rj + γ max_a' Q(φj+1, a'; θ)
        Perform a gradient descent step on (yj - Q(φj, aj; θ))^2 with respect to the network parameters θ
    end for
end for
