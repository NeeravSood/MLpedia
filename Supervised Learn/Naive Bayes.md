**Algorithm Name:** Naive Bayes  
**Type:** Supervised Learning  
**Category:** Classification  

**Overview**  
Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features. They are particularly suited for high-dimensional datasets and are a popular choice due to their simplicity and efficiency.

**Key Concepts**
- **Probability Model:** The Naive Bayes classifier combines a simple probability model with Bayes' theorem.
- **Conditional Independence:** Assumes that the value of a particular feature is independent of the value of any other feature, given the class variable.
- **Prior Probability:** Prior probability of each class (based on the training data) plays a crucial role in the prediction.

**How It Works**  
Naive Bayes works by calculating the posterior probability of each class based on the input features. The class with the highest posterior probability is considered the most likely class. The algorithm uses the following formula:
\[ P(C_k|x) = \frac{P(x|C_k)P(C_k)}{P(x)} \]
Where:
- \(P(C_k|x)\) is the posterior probability of class \(C_k\) given predictor(s) \(x\).
- \(P(x|C_k)\) is the likelihood which is the probability of predictor(s) \(x\) given class \(C_k\).
- \(P(C_k)\) is the prior probability of class \(C_k\).
- \(P(x)\) is the prior probability of predictor(s).

**Implementation (Language-Specific)**  
Here's how you can implement a Naive Bayes classifier using Python and the `sklearn` library:

**Python Example:**

```python
def naive_bayes_example(features, target):
    from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
    model = GaussianNB()
    model.fit(features, target)
    return model
```

**Applications**  
Naive Bayes classifiers are widely used in various applications such as:
- **Spam Detection:** Classifying emails as spam or not spam.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text.
- **Document Classification:** Categorizing documents into predefined topics based on their content.

**Strengths**
- **Efficiency:** Extremely fast compared to more sophisticated methods.
- **Scalability:** Works well with large datasets and high-dimensional data.

**Limitations**
- **Assumption of Independence:** In reality, features may depend on each other, but Naive Bayes treats them as independent.
- **Data Scarcity:** Requires a large amount of data to calculate the probability of different classes effectively.
