**Algorithm Name:** Decision Trees  
**Type:** Supervised Learning  
**Category:** Classification/Regression  

**Overview**  
Decision Trees are a type of predictive modeling algorithm that are used for both classification and regression tasks. They involve splitting data into branches to make decisions based on features. This method was developed from the theory of decision analysis in the 1960s.

**Key Concepts**  
- **Node:** Represents a feature or decision point, splitting the data.
- **Branch:** Outcome of a decision, leading to further splits or a leaf.
- **Leaf:** End node that provides the output after all decisions.

**How It Works**  
Decision Trees split the data into subsets based on the value of input features, creating a model that predicts the value of the target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from prior data.

**Mathematical Model**  
(Optional) Gini Impurity, Information Gain, and Entropy are often used to measure the best point to split the data.

**Pseudocode**  
```
if condition then
    branch A
else
    branch B
```

**Implementation (Language-Specific)**  
Example code snippet in Python.

**Python Example:**
```python
def decision_tree_example(features, target):
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
    model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
    model.fit(features, target)
    return model
```

**Applications**  
- Decision Trees are used in customer relationship management, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis.

**Strengths**  
- **Easy to Understand:** Visualizations make it easy to interpret.
- **Non-linear Relationships:** Does not require linear features.

**Limitations**  
- **Overfitting:** Can create overly complex trees that do not generalize well.
- **Instability:** Small changes in data can lead to a completely different tree.
