Algorithm Name: Logistic Regression  
Type: Supervised Learning  
Category: Classification  

Overview:  
Logistic Regression is a statistical method for predicting binary outcomes. Its roots can be traced back to the early 20th century, initially used in biological sciences and later adopted in a wide range of industries.

Key Concepts:  
- Odds Ratio: The ratio of the probability of an event occurring to its non-occurrence.
- Decision Boundary: A threshold at which the predicted probability changes class membership.
- Loss Function: Specifically, logistic loss is used to measure the fit.

How It Works:  
Logistic Regression estimates the probability of a binary response based on one or more predictor variables. It uses the logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.

Mathematical Model:  
\[ P(Y=1|X) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1X)}} \]

Pseudocode:  
```
Input: Training data
Output: Model coefficients
Procedure:
  Initialize coefficients
  For each iteration:
    Calculate predictions
    Update coefficients based on gradient
```

Implementation (Python):  
```python
def logistic_regression(X, y):
     Implementation
    return model
```

Applications:  
- Medical fields (disease diagnosis)
- Financial services (credit scoring)
- Marketing (customer churn prediction)

Strengths:  
- Simple and efficient for binary classification problems.
- Provides probabilities for outcomes.

Limitations:  
- Assumes linearity between dependent and independent variables.
- Not suitable for more complex relationships or multi-class scenarios.
