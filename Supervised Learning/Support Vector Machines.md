**Algorithm Name:** Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
**Type:** Supervised Learning  
**Category:** Classification/Regression  

**Overview**  
Support Vector Machines (SVM) are a robust and versatile class of supervised machine learning algorithms used for both classification and regression. They are particularly well-suited for classification of complex but small- or medium-sized datasets.

**Key Concepts**  
- **Margin:** The gap between the two classes that the SVM aims to maximize.
- **Support Vectors:** Data points closest to the decision boundary, crucial in defining the hyperplane.
- **Hyperplane:** The decision boundary that separates different classes.

**How It Works**  
SVM constructs a hyperplane in a high-dimensional space to separate different classes. The best hyperplane is the one that represents the largest separation, or margin, between the classes.

**Mathematical Model**  
(Optional) The algorithm solves a quadratic optimization problem to maximize the margin.

**Pseudocode**  
```
Choose hyperplane with the greatest margin
for each data point
    if correct classification
        continue
    else
        adjust hyperplane
```

**Implementation (Language-Specific)**  
Example code snippet in Python.

**Python Example:**
```python
from sklearn import svm
def svm_example(features, target):
    model = svm.SVC()
    model.fit(features, target)
    return model
```

**Applications**  
- Image recognition, text categorization, bioinformatics (e.g., cancer classification), and many areas of science and business requiring categorical distinction.

**Strengths**  
- **Effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces.**
- **Memory efficiency:** Uses a subset of training points in the decision function.

**Limitations**  
- **Not suitable for large datasets:** The computational complexity can be prohibitive.
- **Requires careful tuning of parameters:** The choice of kernel and regularization can greatly influence performance.
