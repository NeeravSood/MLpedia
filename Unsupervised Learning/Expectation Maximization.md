#Algorithm Name: Expectation Maximization (EM)

**Type**: Unsupervised Learning  
**Category**: Clustering/Density Estimation

## Overview
Expectation Maximization is a statistical algorithm used for finding maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in probabilistic models, where the model depends on unobserved latent variables. Developed in 1977, it iteratively optimizes the likelihood function, handling incomplete datasets effectively.

## Key Concepts
- **Latent Variables**: Unobserved variables that affect the observed data.
- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**: Method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model.
- **Convergence**: The process where the algorithm iteratively improves parameter estimates until changes are negligible.

## How It Works
1. **Expectation Step**: Calculate the expected value of the log-likelihood function, with respect to the conditional distribution of the latent variables given the observed data and current parameter estimates.
2. **Maximization Step**: Find the parameter values that maximize the expected log-likelihood found in the E step.

## Mathematical Model
The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm involves a mathematical model used to find the most likely parameters of a statistical model when dealing with datasets that include unobserved (latent) variables. Here's a simplified explanation of the model:

1. **Expectation Step (E-step)**: In this step, the algorithm estimates the latent variables based on the observed data and the current estimates of the model parameters. This involves calculating what the data is likely telling us about the hidden aspects of the model, given the current parameter values.

2. **Maximization Step (M-step)**: Based on the estimations made in the E-step, the algorithm then adjusts the parameters of the model to maximize the likelihood of the data. This step involves recalculating the parameters to better fit the data, considering the estimates of the latent variables.

These two steps are repeated iteratively. In each iteration, the E-step gives a better estimate of the latent variables based on the current parameters, and the M-step optimizes the parameters based on these new estimates. This process continues until the changes in the parameter estimates are minimal, indicating that the algorithm has converged to a set of parameters that best fit the model to the data.

## Pseudocode
```
initialize parameters θ
repeat until convergence:
    E-step: compute expected log-likelihood, Q(θ|θ_old)
    M-step: update θ to maximize Q(θ|θ_old)
```

## Implementation (Python Example)
```python
def EM_algorithm(data, initial_params):
    # Implementation
    return updated_params
```

## Applications
- **Cluster Analysis in Data Mining**: Identifying groups with similar characteristics.
- **Learning Mixture Models**: Modeling and identifying more than one underlying probability distribution.
- **Medical Image Analysis**: Improving the quality and usability of medical imaging.
- **Bioinformatics**: Analyzing complex biological data.

## Strengths
- **Robust to Missing Data**: Effectively handles incomplete datasets.
- **Flexible Framework**: Adaptable to various statistical models.

## Limitations
- **Convergence to Local, Not Global, Maxima**: May not reach the best overall solution.
- **Sensitive to Initial Values**: Initial parameter settings can affect the outcomes significantly.
