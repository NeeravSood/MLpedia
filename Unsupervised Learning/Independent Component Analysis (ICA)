Algorithm Name: Independent Component Analysis (ICA)

Type: Unsupervised Learning  
Category: Dimensionality Reduction

Overview  
Independent Component Analysis is a computational method for separating a multivariate signal into additive, independent non-Gaussian signals. It is widely used for applications like blind source separation, where the goal is to recover independent signals from their mixtures.

Key Concepts
- Statistical Independence: Each component maximizes statistical independence from the others.
- Non-Gaussianity: ICA exploits non-Gaussianity of the data to achieve separation.
- Whitening: Data is typically preprocessed to make it white or decorrelated.

How It Works  
1. Preprocess the data to center and whiten it.
2. Choose an initial random weight matrix.
3. Iterate over the data to adjust weights that maximize non-Gaussianity of outputs.
4. Separate the mixed signals into statistically independent components.

Mathematical Model  
ICA model can be represented as \( \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{s} \), where \( \mathbf{x} \) is the observed signals, \( \mathbf{A} \) is the mixing matrix, and \( \mathbf{s} \) are the independent components.

Pseudocode

Implementation (Python)
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.decomposition import FastICA

def perform_ica(data, components):
    ica = FastICA(n_components=components)
    S = ica.fit_transform(data)   Reconstruct signals
    return S
```

Applications
- Medical imaging (e.g., fMRI analysis)
- Financial time series analysis
- Audio signal separation
- Feature extraction in machine learning

Strengths
- Effective in separating non-Gaussian signal sources.
- Does not require prior knowledge of the source signals.

Limitations
- Performance highly dependent on non-Gaussianity of data.
- May be sensitive to noise and outliers.
