# Algorithm Name: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

**Type**: Unsupervised Learning

**Category**: Dimensionality Reduction

## Overview:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to emphasize variation and bring out strong patterns in a dataset. It's often used to make data easy to explore and visualize by reducing the number of variables.

## Key Concepts:
- **Variance**: PCA seeks to maximize variance to retain as much information as possible.
- **Orthogonality**: Components are orthogonal to each other, ensuring they are uncorrelated.
- **Transformation**: Data is transformed to a new coordinate system where the greatest variances are on the axes.

## How It Works:
1. Standardize the data.
2. Compute the covariance matrix.
3. Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
4. Sort eigenvectors by decreasing eigenvalues.
5. Project the data onto the space defined by the top eigenvectors.

## Mathematical Model:
PCA involves the eigendecomposition of a covariance matrix or singular value decomposition of a data matrix, typically centered by subtracting the mean of each variable.

## Pseudocode
```plaintext
function PCA(data, num_components):
    standardized_data = standardize(data)
    covariance_matrix = compute_covariance(standardized_data)
    eigenvectors, eigenvalues = decompose(covariance_matrix)
    sorted_indices = sort_indices_by_eigenvalues(eigenvalues)
    return project_data(standardized_data, eigenvectors, sorted_indices, num_components)
```

## Implementation (Python)
```python
import numpy as np

def pca(X, num_components):
    X = (X - np.mean(X, axis=0)) / np.std(X, axis=0)
    covariance_matrix = np.cov(X, rowvar=False)
    eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eigh(covariance_matrix)
    sorted_indices = np.argsort(eigenvalues)[::-1]
    return X @ eigenvectors[:, sorted_indices[:num_components]]
```

## Applications:
- **Data Visualization**: Reducing dimensions to visualize high-dimensional data.
- **Noise Reduction**: Removing noise from the data while retaining the important features.
- **Feature Extraction**: Creating new features that summarize the original variables.

## Strengths:
- **Efficiency**: Efficiently reduces dimensionality, simplifying the data without losing essential information.
- **Versatility**: Applicable to almost any data type, widely used in finance, genetics, and other fields.

## Limitations:
- **Sensitivity to scaling**: Performance heavily depends on data scaling.
- **Data loss**: Some information is inevitably lost during the dimensionality reduction process.
